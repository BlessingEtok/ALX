            <h1> Quora</h1>
            <p> <strong>Quora</strong> is an American question and-answer website where questions are asked , answered, followed, and edited by internet users, either factually or in form of opinions. its owner, Quora,inc.,is based in Mountain View ,California,united States .</p>
            <h2>Why Quora Exists</h2>
            <p>Quora’s mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. A vast amount of the knowledge that would be valuable to many people is currently only available to a few — either locked in people’s heads, or only accessible to select groups. We want to connect the people who have knowledge to the people who need it, to bring together people with different perspectives so they can understand each other better, and to empower everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.</p>
            <h3>Gather Around a Question</h3>
            <p>The heart of Quora is questions — questions that affect the world, questions that explain recent world events, questions that guide important life decisions, and questions that provide insights into why other people think differently. Quora is a place where you can ask questions you care about and get answers that are amazing.

                Quora has only one version of each question. It doesn’t have a left wing version, a right wing version, a western version, and an eastern version. Quora brings together people from different worlds to answer the same question, in the same place — and to learn from each other. We want Quora to be the place to voice your opinion because Quora is where the debate is happening. We want the Quora answer to be the definitive answer for everybody forever.</p>
